# mintPiper

Make Linux Mint (MATE) speak what's on the screen: clearly and securely. 

## Introduction: What/Why.
I use Linux Mint (MATE), and have been looking for a decent and secure way to read my screen in high quality, legible audio.  

My primary requirements were:
1. It must be good quality audio.
2. Privacy and security concerns: My data must not leave my machine.

I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/piper">piper</a>: an awesome, fast and most importantly, local neural text to speech system. They have done such funtastic work and I was able to create `mintPiper` which converts the highlighted text into good quality audio. 


Once I've highlighted text on my screen (whether it is in my browser, terminal or pdf reader), I can have its high quality audio generated and played back by pressing `ctrl+alt+p` on my keyboard or by clicking the icon on my panel.

## Demo
Here's a [short demo video.](https://evuraan.info/evuraan/stuff/mintPiperDemo.mp4)

## Setup

Cone this repo, and run setup.sh with the args of a folder to create and write to, and your h/w arch:

<pre>
  $ git clone https://github.com/anmathew/mintPiper.git FIX THIS!
  $ cd mintPiper 
  $ ./setup.sh /tools/piper amd64
</pre>
`setup.sh` will check for dependencies and when it completes, it would have something like this as its last lines of output:
<pre>
âœ… ... Complete
ðŸŸ¢ For keyboard shortcut: xterm -e "/tools/piper/piper/playSelectedTTS.sh"
ðŸŸ¢ For panel startup application: /tools/piper/piper/mintPiper.py
</pre>
We need the last two lines, so make a note of those. 
### Add a keyboard shortcut
Launch `Keyboard Shortcuts` from your menu, and add a new shortcut. 

The command would be what was shown in your `ðŸŸ¢ For keyboard shortcut:` output. 

So, in my case, the command would be: `xterm -e "/tools/piper/piper/playSelectedTTS.sh"`. Map this shortcut to a keycombo of your choice. 

I preferred `ctrl alt p` as the shortcut. 

Once you save,  highlight some legible text and press your keyboard shortcut. It should play that back in high-quality, locally created audio.

### Add a Desktop Launchers
Add a desktop launcher (the icon that would appear on the left side of your desktop window). 

Point this launcher to  `xterm -e "/tools/piper/piper/playSelectedTTS.sh"`. Use an image from the images folder as the icon thumbnail.

### Add a panel icon 

Optionally, you can create a Desktop Icon too, which appears on the right side of the desktop screen:

Find and launch `Startup Applications Preferences` from your menu. Add a startup application. 

The command should be what was shown in your `ðŸŸ¢ For panel startup application:` output from above. 

In my example, the command then would be `/tools/piper/piper/mintPiper.py`:

When you login to the desktop next time, you should see the panel icon as in my screenshot above. Left click and select `Run Piper TTS`, and it should play clear audio of your selected text. 

## Uninstall:
1. Remove the startup application from your `Startup Applications Preferences`.
2. Remove the keyboard shortcut you added.
3. Remove the folder you installed `mintPiper` into. In my example, that would be `/tools/piper` directory.
